# 🧪 Usability Test Plan

**Project:** CampusDine App
**Location:** City Interaction Lab
**Duration:** 40–50 Minutes per session

---

## 🎯 1. Objectives
The primary goal of this usability test is to evaluate the effectiveness of the **CampusDine** high-fidelity prototype in facilitating core dining tasks. specifically focusing on:
* **Dietary Filtering:** Can users easily find Halal options?
* **Pre-Ordering:** Is the flow from menu to checkout intuitive?
* **Facility Discovery:** Can users interpret the map to find seating and microwaves?

---

## 👥 2. Methodology
* **Participants:** 5 Users (Mix of Students and Staff from City, St George's).
* **Incentive:** £10 Voucher.
* **Technique:** **Think-Aloud Protocol**. Users are asked to verbalise their thought process while navigating.
* **Data Collection:** Screen recording, audio recording, and facial expression observation (via camera).

---

## 📋 3. Task Scenarios
Participants will be asked to complete three realistic tasks using the prototype:

### Task A: Discovery & Filtering
*"You have a short break and want to find a specific meal. Locate a **Halal-friendly** food outlet and browse the available menu choices."*
* **Goal:** Test the visibility and logic of the "Quick Filters" and dietary badges.

### Task B: Pre-Ordering
*"You are currently in a lecture and want to grab lunch immediately after. Select a meal, customise it (e.g., add sides), and **pre-order it for pickup**."*
* **Goal:** Assess the user experience of the ordering flow, basket, and payment sections.

### Task C: Facility Navigation
*"You have collected your food but the canteen is full. Use the app to find the nearest **available seating area**."*
* **Goal:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the interactive Map layer and live status indicators.

## 📊 4. Success Metrics
We will capture both qualitative and quantitative data:

* **Single Ease Question (SEQ):** Administered after *each task* (Rated 1-7) to measure immediate task difficulty.
* **System Usability Scale (SUS):** Administered *post-test* via Qualtrics to measure overall perceived usability.
* **Observational Data:** Recording instances of user hesitation, confusion, and unexpected behavioural responses.
