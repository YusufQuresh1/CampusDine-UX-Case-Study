## 📍 Overview
**CampusDine** is a mobile application concept developed to address the logistical frustrations students and staff face when accessing food on campus.

Developed as a comprehensive coursework project for the **User-Centred Systems Design** module at City, St George's, this case study demonstrates my ability to execute a full product design lifecycle—from initial discovery and qualitative research to high-fidelity prototyping and usability validation.

**The Challenge:** User research revealed that students were skipping meals or arriving late to lectures due to unpredictable queues, unclear dietary labelling, and a lack of information regarding facility locations.

---

## 🔍 01-User-Research
To ensure the solution was grounded in real user needs, I conducted semi-structured interviews with **5 participants** (3 Students, 2 Staff). Transcripts were analysed using Thematic Analysis to identify core pain points.

**Key Insights:**
* **Queue Anxiety:** Long queues frequently caused students to be late for lectures. One participant noted, *"There was a long queue and then I was late for my lecture"*.
* **Dietary Uncertainty (Halal):** A critical finding was the lack of visible Halal certification. Users often waited in line just to ask staff if food was suitable, causing delays and stress.
* **Hidden Facilities:** Users were unaware of essential free facilities. One participant admitted, *"I didn't even know that we have microwaves in the uni"*.
* **Seating Scarcity:** Overcrowding in the main canteen often forced users to eat in corridors due to a lack of space.

## 👤 02-Personas
Based on the research data, two primary personas were developed to guide the design decisions:

* **Sana (Student):** Needs to eat comfortably between back-to-back lectures but struggles to find Halal options and microwaves.
* **Arif (Staff):** Prioritises speed and convenience to maximise his lunch break but avoids the canteen due to unpredictable queues.

## 🗺 03-User-Journey-Map
I mapped the existing "As-Is" journey for a student attempting to get lunch between lectures. This visualisation highlights the emotional dip caused by long queues and the frustration of eating cold food due to missing microwave information.

## 🎬 04-Storyboard
This storyboard illustrates the "To-Be" scenario where the **Sana** persona uses CampusDine to:
1.  Check queue times before leaving class.
2.  Filter menus for Halal options.
3.  Pre-order lunch to skip the line.
4.  Locate a microwave to reheat leftovers later in the day.

## 📱 05-Wireframes
I designed 6 key screens and a user flow diagram to visualise the solution.

**Key Screens Designed:**
* **Home Screen:** Features "Quick Filters" (Hot/Cold/Halal) and live "Busyness" indicators.
* **Menu Interface:** Includes clear calorie and dietary badges (Halal/Veg) to reduce decision time.
* **Smart Map:** A dedicated feature allowing users to toggle **Seating** (Live capacity), **Microwaves**, and **Water Fountains** with status updates.
* **Basket:** Includes specific time-slot selection for pickup to align with lecture breaks.

## 🧪 06-Usability-Testing
To validate the design, a usability test plan was created for 5 new participants using the **City Interaction Lab**.

* **Tasks:** Locate a Halal meal, pre-order for a specific time, and find a microwave using the map.
* **Metrics:** Success is measured using the **Single Ease Question (SEQ)** after tasks and the **System Usability Scale (SUS)** post-test.

## 🎯 Outcome
This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my UX capabilities, highlighting:
* **Research-Led Design:** Ability to transform qualitative interview data into actionable UI features.
* **Inclusive Design:** Addressing specific accessibility needs (Halal visibility) alongside logistical pain points.
* **Professional Documentation:** Producing industry-standard artefacts including personas, journey maps, and annotated wireframes.
